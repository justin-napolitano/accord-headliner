# Honda Accord Headliner Replacement

## Motivation and Problem

The headliner in a 12-year-old Honda Accord had deteriorated significantly. The foam backing had disintegrated, causing the fabric to sag and lose adhesion. Given the vehicle's age and budget constraints, replacing the entire headliner assembly was not a viable option. The project aims to restore the headliner by removing the old fabric and foam, preparing the board, and installing a new fabric with insulation suitable for a hot climate.

## Approach and Implementation

The process begins with sourcing replacement materials. An old quilt with polyester batting was repurposed as insulation to mitigate heat transfer, complemented by layers of mylar emergency blankets to reflect solar heat. This choice reflects practical reuse of available materials rather than commercial automotive insulation.

Removal of the headliner was facilitated by plastic rivets and roof accessories, which were carefully detached. A referenced YouTube video provided visual guidance on this step.

The old fabric was peeled off manually. The foam backing had fully deteriorated, requiring careful removal using dry brushing and adhesive remover solvents. Wet brushing was initially attempted but proved counterproductive by spreading adhesive residues.

Safety precautions included the use of masks and safety glasses to avoid inhaling foam particles during removal.

Once the board was cleaned and prepared, the new headliner fabric was cut to size and positioned. The documentation indicates that installation steps and final photos remain incomplete.

## Technical Notes

- The project is documented entirely in Markdown with embedded images and references.
- The photos directory contains visual records of each stage.
- The use of emergency blankets as radiant barriers is a practical adaptation for the Texas climate.
- Adhesive removal required solvent application and rinsing with a damp rag to ensure a clean surface.

## Summary

This project serves as a practical reference for DIY automotive upholstery repair focused on headliner replacement. It emphasizes cost-effective material reuse, careful preparation, and safety considerations. The documentation is intended as a technical guide for future reference rather than a polished tutorial.

Further work is needed to complete the installation documentation and provide detailed material and tool recommendations.
