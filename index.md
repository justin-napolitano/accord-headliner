# Justin-ify a Car Headliner

## Installing a Suitable Headliner

Hey there! I’m Justin Napolitano, and I want to share a little project I recently tackled on my 12-year-old Honda Accord — redoing the headliner. If you’re like me, you love your car but sometimes the wear and tear just gets to it. In my case, the foam holding the headliner fabric had completely deteriorated, turning it into a sad, saggy mess. 

### Why I Did This

Living in Texas means dealing with some seriously hot summers. The original headliner was falling apart, and without some insulation, the sun’s heat would just bake me inside my car. Buying a new headliner was out of the question — my car is too old, and my wallet too light. So, I decided to DIY it with some materials I already had around.

### What I Used

- **Old Quilt:** I had an old quilt with some poly batting that I figured would make a decent insulating layer.
- **Mylar Emergency Blankets:** I added a sheet or two of these to the top of the headliner board to reflect heat away from the passenger compartment.

### The Process

The headliner was held by a few plastic rivets and roof accessories. I found a helpful YouTube video ([Headline Removal Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVpBV9uR7Z8)) that guided me through the removal.

Peeling off the fabric was surprisingly easy, but the foam underneath was a nightmare. It had completely deteriorated, so I recommend wearing a mask and safety glasses when scraping it off. I initially made the mistake of using a wet brush, which just made the adhesive stick everywhere. Once dry, I scrubbed off as much foam as I could, then used adhesive remover to get rid of the old glue. After letting the solvent work, I rinsed everything with a slightly damp rag.

### Installing the New Headliner

The next step was to cut the new headliner material to size and place it onto the board. I planned to use the quilt and mylar layers to help with insulation and heat reflection. 

### What I Learned

- Safety first: old foam can be messy and potentially harmful, so protective gear is a must.
- Patience pays off: letting adhesive remover do its work before scrubbing saved me a lot of frustration.
- Using materials you already have can make a project affordable and rewarding.

## Why this project matters for my career

As a developer, I spend a lot of time solving problems logically and creatively. Taking on a hands-on DIY project like this reminds me that problem-solving isn’t just about code — it’s about persistence, adaptability, and making do with what you have. Documenting this project also helps me improve my technical writing skills and share knowledge clearly, which is invaluable when collaborating on software projects or contributing to open source. Plus, it’s a fun break from the screen!
